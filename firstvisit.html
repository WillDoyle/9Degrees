          <h2>Do I need to book?</h2>
        </summary>
        <ol>
          No, no need to book! Come by any time during our opening hours.

        </summary>
        <ol>
          Any clothes you're comfortable working out and getting sweaty in are great. <br><br>

          We require the use of climbing shoes for safety, cleanliness and extra stability on the wall. You can either
          hire a pair for $7 (or if it's your first visit they're free!) or bring your own if you have them. We strictly
          do not allow barefoot or open toed shoe climbing in the interest of both safety and hygiene.

        <ol>
          First and foremost we are an adult sporting facility most suitable for those roughly 5ft tall and above.
          Climbers under the age of 16 are best suited to more child friendly facilities. For more details please refer
          to our <a class="link__hover-effect kids__link" href="under18.html">kids guidelines</a>.

          <h2>How long can I climb for?</h2>
        </summary>
        <ol>
          As long as you like! Entry works as a full day pass, so once you've paid you're welcome to stick around, grab
          a coffee and climb until your arms feel like jelly. <br><br>

          Groups are very welcome. Any groups of 9 or larger are eligible for a 9% disount on their entry prices if the
          group pays in a single transaction. We do not offer organised group events but you are welcome to use 9
          Degrees as your venue. 
          
          <br><br>
          Although we do not require bookings we would appreciate it if you contact us ahead of
          your visit so we can prepare for your arrival.

          <h2>Can I bring my dog?</h2>
        </summary>
        <ol>
          Your fury friend is very welcome to visit all 9 Degrees gyms with the exception of our Parramatta location. <br><br>

We ask that dogs are kept on leash for the duration of your session and do not become disruptive or overly excited. Please do not bring your dog if it is not comfortable around large groups, loud noises or has a tendency to bark. Although we love dogs the climbing gym is a space for them to nap, not play. <br><br>

It's important to remember that while some of us love dogs, not everybody does! Barking, whining and excited dogs can be very disruptive to those simply trying to climb. Bringing your pet is a bonus, not a right. Due to the strict nature of pets in the gym we would recommend leaving your pet at home for your first visit. <br><br>

We reserve the right to ask any dogs to leave at any time if they cannot behave suitably. Before bringing your dog please read our full guidelines here <br><br>
