        Most climbers pride themselves on being green; bringing that same ethos

        We’re proud to be ‘doing our bit’ by donating 1% of profits and
        providing carbon neutral bouldering; continuing that feeling of

        Deforestation remains one of the most important issues of our time.

        <br />
        <br />
        Rainforest Rescue is a not-for-profit organisation that has been
        protecting and restoring rainforests both in Australia and
        internationally since 1999.
        <br /><br />
        Over the past 20 years a key focus of their work has been the buy-back
        and reforestation of the lowland Daintree rainforest – an
        internationally important, ancient and unique area that needs
        protection. <br /><br />

        To date they have planted over 290,000 native trees throughout Australia
        and saved 36 large rainforest properties from logging; conserving the
        homes of beloved and threatened Australian wildlife.

        </summary>
        <ol>
          Experts have warned for years that inaction on Carbon Emissions will
          lead to drastic climate changes and socio-economic disasters. To
          prevent this, we all need to take account of our carbon emissions and
          make continued efforts to reduce them.

          <br /><br />
          Our world is at a tipping point: it has never been more
          crucial to reassess our impacts on the environment, as individuals and
          organisations, and take actions to reduce or eliminate this impact.
          One of the most significant ways to do this is by reducing our carbon
          footprint.

          The next, much harder step, is to analyse the carbon emissions related
          opening new 9 Degrees venues as well as eliminating our carbon legacy
          from our 6 years of operations. The suppliers required to establish a
          new gym (e.g. climbing wall builders and hold suppliers) are mostly
          unable to tell us their carbon footprints, making it hard to
          accurately offset these.

          <br /><br />
          We are pushing hard for change and I think we will get there
          eventually as they too are becoming aware of the need for better
          practices. We are all in this together and hopefully we can lift the
          industry as one.
